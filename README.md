### Hi guys ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan, I'm 21 and from Brasil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the Federal University of EspÃ­rito Santo.

I can code React Native, Firebase, NodeJS, React, HTML and CSS.

I also know a few concepts about Flutter and MongoDB.

I can work remotely at companies across the globe, as long as I can communicate in English or Portuguese, so if you need me for anything, feel free to contact me :grin:
